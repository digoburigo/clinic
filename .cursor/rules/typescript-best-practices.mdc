- Enable TypeScript strict mode in tsconfig.json to enhance type safety and catch potential errors early.
- Prefer types over interfaces for defining object shapes.
- Implement comprehensive error handling using type guards and specific error types.
- Use advanced TypeScript features like conditional and mapped types for complex scenarios.
- Leverage module resolution and path aliases for improved project maintainability.
- Implement generics for reusable components and functions.
- Utilize type guards and assertions for runtime type checking.
