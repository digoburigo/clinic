- Use React Hook Form for efficient form state management and validation.
- Use controlled components for better performance and easier state management.
- Implement form validation using Zod for improved type safety and error handling.
- Implement clear error handling and user feedback for form validation issues.
- Leverage React Hook Form's performance optimizations like lazy registration.
- Implement proper validation using React Hook Form's built-in validation with Zod.
- Utilize the `useForm` hook's `watch` function for real-time form state updates.
- Use the `useFormContext` hook for sharing form state across nested components.
