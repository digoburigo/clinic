- Centralize Prisma Client usage to prevent multiple instances and improve performance.
- Implement robust error handling and logging for all Prisma operations.
- Utilize Prisma's type-safe query API to reduce runtime errors and enhance maintainability.
- Leverage relation fields and nested writes for efficient data modeling and querying.
- Implement a disciplined migration strategy and version control for your Prisma schema.
- Use Prisma Client in server-side code only, not in the browser.
- Implement proper error handling for database operations.
- Utilize Prisma's query raw feature for complex queries when needed.
- Regularly run `prisma migrate dev` to keep schema and migrations in sync.
