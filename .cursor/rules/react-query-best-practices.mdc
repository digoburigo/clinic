- Use React Query for efficient server state management and data fetching.
- Implement strategic query keys and caching to optimize performance.
- Utilize the mutation API for handling side effects and optimistic UI updates.
- Implement comprehensive error handling and loading states for improved UX.
- Leverage React Query devtools for debugging and optimizing your queries.
- Use `useQuery` for fetching data and `useMutation` for data modifications.
