- Use functional components and hooks over class components for better readability and reusability.
- Implement React.memo and useMemo for performance optimization where necessary.
- Adhere strictly to React hooks rules to prevent common errors.
- Utilize React.lazy and Suspense for code-splitting and lazy loading of components.
- Implement error boundaries to manage and display errors effectively.
- Be aware that this is a NextJS project and utilize React in the best way within the meta framework.
